After key threshold is met
	Query server for matching contacts.
		if a match is found, display it below the input and make it selectable.
			(ideally the returned result set should be limited)
			when selected, the proper contact name is appended to the text box and
			the id of the selected contact is saved. 

			Once the user presses save, the form is validated and if complete sent
			back to the API for creation.

		if no match is found, provide a 'create contact' link which when pressed
		displays a sub-form below the current or alternatively show a different dialog.
